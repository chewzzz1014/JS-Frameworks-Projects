Who Is Brad Traversy?

I started coding in 2007 at the age of 26. I became a full-time educator & content creator in 2016.

I show people that they don't have to be a straight A student or a genius to learn to code. I break down complex concepts by showing you how to implement them in project-based courses and tutorials.
